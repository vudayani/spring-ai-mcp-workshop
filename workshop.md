# Workshop Quick Reference Guide
## From Prompts to Agents: Supercharging Spring Boot Apps with AI and MCP

This guide provides quick reference commands and snippets for the workshop. Keep this handy during the session!

## ðŸ”§ Pre-Workshop Setup Verification

### 1. Verify AI Provider API Key
**OpenAI:**
```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SPRING_AI_OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"model": "gpt-4o", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke"}]}'
```

**Anthropic:**
```bash
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  --header "x-api-key: $SPRING_AI_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "content-type: application/json" \
  --data '{"model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "max_tokens": 1024, "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke"}]}'
```

### 2. Verify GitHub Access Token
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user
```
*Should return your GitHub user profile information*

If you don't have GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT), you can create one by following the below steps:

1.  **Create a Personal Access Token**: Follow the [official GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) to create a "classic" token. When prompted for scopes, select the following:
    *   `repo`
    *   `read:org`
    *   `read:user`

2.  **Store Your Token**: It is recommended to store your token in an environment variable or a `.env` file.

    **Option A: Environment Variable**
    ```bash
    export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN='<your-github-token>'
    ```

    **Option B: .env file**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add the following line:
    ```
    GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN='<your-github-token>'
    ```
    To prevent accidentally committing your token, add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file:
    ```bash
    echo ".env" >> .gitignore
    ```

## ðŸš€ Workshop Demo Commands

### 1. Explore MCP with Model Inspector

**Filesystem Server:**
```bash
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /path/to/a/directory
```
*Replace `/path/to/a/directory` with a real path (e.g., your Desktop)*

### 2. Locate Docker (binary path for MCP config)
If Docker is already on your PATH, you can simply use `"command":"docker"`:
```bash
{
 "mcpServers": {
   "github": {
     "command": "docker",
     "args": [
        "run", "-i", "--rm",
        "-e", "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server",
        "stdio"
     ]
}
```
However, if you see an error like:
```bash
`Caused by: java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "docker": error=2, No such file or directory`
```
It means your Java process canâ€™t find Docker, even though it works in your Terminal.

This often happens when running your app from an IDE or as a background process â€” those environments usually inherit a trimmed PATH, missing Dockerâ€™s directory.

Option 1: Launch your app from the Terminal
Run your Spring Boot app directly from a Terminal where Docker works:
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
This ensures the PATH from your shell (which includes Docker) is used by the app.

Option 2: Use the absolute path to Docker
If you still face issues, find the full path to Docker and use it in your MCP config.

#### macOS / Linux (bash/zsh):
```bash
which docker
# or
command -v docker
```

#### Windows (CMD):
```bash
where docker
```

**Note**: Use the full path reported by these commands in your MCP config.
Example (Windows): C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\resources\bin\docker.exe
In JSON, escape backslashes: C:\\Program Files\\Docker\\Docker\\resources\\bin\\docker.exe

Then update your MCP config:
```bash
"command": "/opt/homebrew/bin/docker"
```

### 3. Build and Run MCP Client Demo

**Navigate to client directory:**
```bash
cd mcp-client-demo
```

**Run the application:**
```bash
../mvnw spring-boot:run
```

**Test GitHub endpoint:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/github-create-issue?repoOwner=vudayani&repoName=spring-ai-mcp-workshop"
```

### 4. Configure On-Call Server in Client

**Add to `mcp-servers-config.json`:**
```json
    "on-call": {
       "command": "java",
       "args": [
           "-jar",
           "../../mcp-server-demo/target/mcp-server-demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"
       ]
    }
```

### 5. Build and Test On-Call Server

**Build the server:**
```bash
cd ../mcp-server-demo
./mvnw clean package
```

**Test on-call endpoint:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/on-call"
```
